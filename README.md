### DISCLAIMER: This is my second script, I dont know anything about scripting
### This might not work on your system or have horrendous programming flaws  

## setBrightnessAllMonitors 
### Description:
This script allows you to change the brightness all of your screens simultaneously.  
There are probably better ways and programs out there of doing this,   
but I already wrote a script for vibrancy, so here we are.

**Use case example**: 
I launch the script with desired values via keybinding.  

### How it works
It provides a nice way of setting the xrandr gamma value of all our outputs

### Usage

*Syntax*:  
  `setBrightnessAllMonitors.sh yourDesiredValueHere`

*Example*:  
  `setBrightnessAllMonitors.sh 0.8`
